## Requirement
Password generator requirements were to generate a password when the button is clicked.

several steps were programed:
- creating an array will all possible options included
- function  getPasswordOptions encompassing all the promts/alerts/confirm as well as chcking if the answers were acceptable
    - here I used the   - .find method    
                        - the .push method
                        - while function
                        - if function
    - I tried to split this function into seperate functions but I couldn't find a working solutions for that
- function to get a randomised string using for loop
- using a function wih .includes found at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-find-if-two-arrays-contain-any-common-item-in-javascript/    
        which allowed me to see if the randomised string contains elements from another array

- the final part of the code was already prepared and I did not need to amend it

## Challenges
I found the most difficult part was the thinking through the logical arguments and ensuring that the while/if/else were used in the correct situations and place of code. Small changes made a large difference to the execution of the code and some of the result was achieved through trial and error.
